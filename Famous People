/* First, I created a table of actors from my favorite movies*/

CREATE TABLE actors (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
fullname TEXT,
age INTEGER,
ethnicity TEXT,
total_awards INTEGER);

INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("Ashton Kutcher", 45, "American", 16);
INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("Mila Kunis", 39, "Ukrainian",9);
INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("Emily Blunt", 40, "British", 6);
INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("John Krasinski", 43, "Polish", 4);
INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("Nichole Kidman", 55, "American_Australian", 109);
INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("Laura Dern", 56, "American", 61);

INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("Kate Winslet", 47, "British", 20);
INSERT INTO actors (fullname, age, ethnicity, total_awards) VALUES ("Reese Witherspoon", 46, "American", 28);


/* Then I added another table with the list of movies and release year*/

CREATE TABLE movies (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
title TEXT,
actor_id INTEGER,
release_year INTEGER);

INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("Avatar 2", 7, 2022);
INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("Wild", 6, 2014);
INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("Avatar 2", 8, 2022);
INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("Avatar 2", 9, 2022);
INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("Wild", 10, 2014);
INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("The Quiet Place", 4, 2018);

INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("Bad Moms", 2, 2016);
INSERT INTO movies (title, actor_id, release_year) VALUES ("YourPlaceOrMine", 1, 2023);

/* I then created a table of actors that are married to each other*/

CREATE TABLE married_actors (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,

actor2_id INTEGER);
      
INSERT INTO married_actors (actor1_id, actor2_id) VALUES (1, 2);
INSERT INTO married_actors (actor1_id, actor2_id) VALUES (3, 4);


/*Next I compared which actors appeared in which films and provided the year the film was released by joining both tables. */

SELECT actors.fullname, movies.title AS movie_title, movies.release_year
FROM actors
LEFT OUTER JOIN movies
ON actors.id=movies.actor_id
ORDER BY release_year desc;

/*I also compared list of actors that are married to each other by combining multiple joins. */

SELECT a.fullname, b.fullname
FROM married_actors
JOIN actors a
ON married_actors.actor1_id=a.id
JOIN actors b
ON married_actors.actor2_id=b.id;

/*Lastly, I filtered records by only showing the actor with the highest awards*/

SELECT fullname as most_award_winning_actress
FROM actors
WHERE total_awards>100;
