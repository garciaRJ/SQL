#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

/*1. How many orders were placed in January?*/

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?*/

SELECT product, SUM (quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE product='iPhone';

###Question 2, answer #2 ###

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

/*3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. */

SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
LEFT OUTER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON customers.order_id = Febsales.orderID
WHERE orderdate IS NOT NULL
AND orderdate <> 'Order Date';

###Question 3, answer #3 ###

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON cust.order_id=FEB.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';


/*4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? */

--First, I find out what's the lowest price within the table JanSales.--

SELECT min (price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

--I then determined which product is the cheapest one sold in January by using subquery and using distinct statement to remove duplicates*/

SELECT distinct product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price= (SELECT min (price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);


#### QUESTION 4 ANSWER #2 ####
SELECT distinct product, price 
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC
LIMIT 1;


/*5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).*/

SELECT product, sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY product asc;

#### QUESTION 5 ANSWER #2 ####

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

/*6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?*/

SELECT product,sum(quantity)*price as revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location='548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY product;

/*7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?*/

SELECT count (distinct cust.acctnum), AVG(feb.quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON feb.OrderID=cust.order_id
WHERE quantity> 2
AND length (orderid)=6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
